# Todo-list
A small app for me to have an overview of all the things I need todo.
It's built using Ruby on Rails 8 using Turbo Frames and Turbo Stream.
The create, edit, show and delete actions where mostly setup using the following Hotrails guide: [Turbo Frames and Turbo Stream templates ](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails/turbo-frames-and-turbo-streams).

Current TODOs on the todo-list
[ ] Fix the "Show" action, such that the todo that's being shown isn't a link
[ ] Add some flavour to the CSS, for example bootstrap
[ ] Add some features other than just the todo action, such as budget, due date, comments
